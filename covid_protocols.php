  <h1>PORTLAND VOLLEYBALL ASSOCIATION COVID-19 ACTION PLAN</h1>
  <h2>Indoor League Play Fall 2021</h2>
  <p>
    In response to the current situation, Portland Volleyball Association (PVA) has developed a set of measures intended to prevent the spread of COVID-19.  The measures below are intended to be followed during scheduled league play.  As new information and guidance from state/county/city agencies becomes available the PVA Board of Directors will revisit and update the guidance as necessary.
  </p>
    The State of Oregon has recently issued statewide masking requirements for indoor spaces, which is in effect from Aug. 13 until Feb. 8, 2022.  Individuals, regardless of vaccination status, are required to wear a mask, face covering or face shield when in an indoor space.  However, the State of Oregon has allowed an exemption for competitive sports.  As per the statewide mandate, players in PVA’s fall indoor league will not be required to wear a mask, face covering or face shield while they are playing volleyball.  However, players will be required to wear a mask, face covering or face shield before the start of their match and after their match until such time as they have left the indoor facility.  Also, referees, spectators, and children 5 and older will be required to wear a mask, face covering or face shield at all times.  The mask, face covering or face shield must completely cover the nose and mouth.
  </p>
  <p>
    PVA will reinforce the statewide mandate.  Players and/or spectators who do not comply with the statewide mandate may be asked to leave the indoor facility.  PVA will monitor the State of Oregon’s guidance and revise the league’s COVID-19 Action Plan as appropriate.

    Although volleyball is an inherently dangerous sport and COVID-19 is recognized as a pandemic, all players must sign a waiver to participate in any PVA activities.  PVA recently revised its standard liability waiver to include information about COVID-19.  All participants - players and referees - must be free of a cough and/or fever (temperature above 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit<sup>1</sup>) symptoms for the last 72 hours and have not been exposed to anyone exhibiting such symptoms within the past 10 days<sup>2</sup>.  Anyone who is exhibiting these symptoms before or during play will be asked to leave immediately.

    <sup>1</sup>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) considers a person to have a fever when they have a measured temperature of at least 100.4 °F [38 °C].
    <br/>
    <sup>2</sup>The CDC advises that based on existing literature, the incubation period (the time from exposure to development of symptoms) of SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses (e.g. MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV) ranges from 2–14 days.
